### Summary of Analysis

- Factors such as months, number of mosquitoes, dewpoint (humidity), location and temperature play an important role in predicting West nile Virus Infections.

- We propose to conduct sprays on identified hotspots during the months of July, August and September

**Summary of Spray costs illustrated on 2013 dataset:**

|Item|Cost|
|---|---|
|Total Savings for 3 human infections per WNV incidence|+ \$ 3,401,700|
|Spray cost for 6 weeks| - \$ 2,858,536|
|Total cost savings| + \$ 543,163|
|Cost saving per additional human infection after 3 infections| + \$ 1,133,900|

### Recommendations

- Optical sensing based counting system to ensure consistent sampling

- Do greater checks on mosquitos on banks of Lake Michigan from Jul - Sep

### Future Works

- Finetune Logistic Regression to better predict number of mosquitos
