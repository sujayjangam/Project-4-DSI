    "West Nile Virus was first detected in North America in 1999, and has been known to cause large-scale human epidemics<sup> 2 </sup>. It is the dominant vector-borne disease in North America, and West Nile Fever has been known to cause encephalitis or meningitis, and even death.\n",
    "\n",
    "West Nile Virus is primarily found in the blood of birds, with the American robin (Turdus migratorius) and house sparrow (Passer domesticus) being two of the most prominent reservoir species of West Nile Virus. As a vector-borne zoonotic disease, West Nile Virus is reliant on mosquitoes as its vectors to infect humans when they draw blood from both WNV-infected animals and humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "The American robin is the favoured target of the Culex genus of mosquitoes, the primary vectors of the West Nile Virus. During Summer, as temperatures increase and the mosquito population starts to flourish, the American robin nests for several weeks in one location, providing Culex mosquitoes plenty of meals and opportunities to ingest West Nile Virus infected blood. This blood is then further transmitted to other animal such as horses, dogs, and humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "As birds are predominantly the preferred target for Culex mosquitoes, the number of human cases of West Nile Virus tend to remain low while the birds are nesting. However, as late Summer and early Fall approaches, the nesting season of birds comes to a close. The avian reservoirs disperse and migrate, causing mosquitoes to feed on humans instead.\n",

    "Known to be a superspreader of West Nile Virus due to its role as a favoured reservoir species of the virus vector Culex mosquitoes, the American robin has a breeding season spanning April to July<sup> 6 </sup>. During this time, upon mating, nesting can take up to 2 weeks before the chick hatches, with another 2 weeks before the chick is able to leave the nest<sup> 7 </sup>, and join the rest of the flock in roosting for the colder months. This tends to occur in late Summer or early Fall, which occurs between August and September in Chicago. During this period due to the lack of their favourite food targets, mosquitoes are more likely to feast on humans which is why this period is when the most number of West Nile Virus human infections occur.\n",
